abstract = {Countries are working into making agriculture more sustainable by integrating different technologies to enhance its operation. Implementing improvements in irrigation systems is crucial for the water-use efficiency and works as a contributor to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the United Nations specifically Goal 6 and Target 6.4. This paper aims to highlight the contribution of SMART irrigation using Internet of Things (IoT) and sensory systems in relation to the SDGs. The study is based on a qualitative design along with focusing on secondary data collection method. Automated irrigation systems are essential for conservation of water, this improvement could have a vital role in minimizing water usage. Agriculture and farming techniques is also linked with IoT and automation, to make the whole processes much more effective and efficient. Sensory systems helped farmers better understand their crops and reduced the environmental impacts and conserve resources. Through these advanced systems effective soil and weather monitoring takes place along with efficient water management. Irrigation systems have been determined as positive contributor toward optimized irrigation systems that could enhance the use of continuous research and development which focus on enhancing the sustainable operations and cost reduction. Lastly, the challenges and benefits for the implementation of sensory based irrigation systems are discussed. This review will assist researchers and farmers to better understand irrigation techniques and provide an adequate approach would be sufficient to carry out irrigation related activities.}

abstract = {The recent intensification of agriculture, and the prospects of
 future intensification, will have major detrimental impacts on the
 nonagricultural terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of the world. The
 doubling of agricultural food production during the past 35 years was
 associated with a 6.87-fold increase in nitrogen fertilization, a
 3.48-fold increase in phosphorus fertilization, a 1.68-fold increase in
 the amount of irrigated cropland, and a 1.1-fold increase in land in
 cultivation. Based on a simple linear extension of past trends, the
 anticipated next doubling of global food production would be associated
 with approximately 3-fold increases in nitrogen and phosphorus
 fertilization rates, a doubling of the irrigated land area, and an 18\%
 increase in cropland. These projected changes would have dramatic
 impacts on the diversity, composition, and functioning of the remaining
 natural ecosystems of the world, and on their ability to provide
 society with a variety of essential ecosystem services. The largest
 impacts would be on freshwater and marine ecosystems, which would be
 greatly eutrophied by high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus release
 from agricultural fields. Aquatic nutrient eutrophication can lead to
 loss of biodiversity, outbreaks of nuisance species, shifts in the
 structure of food chains, and impairment of fisheries. Because of
 aerial redistribution of various forms of nitrogen, agricultural
 intensification also would eutrophy many natural terrestrial ecosystems
 and contribute to atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases. These
 detrimental environmental impacts of agriculture can be minimized only
 if there is much more efficient use and recycling of nitrogen and
 phosphorus in agroecosystems.}}

ABSTRACT = {Climate change is driving new solutions to manage water more efficiently. Such solutions involve the development of smart irrigation systems where Internet of Things (IoT) nodes are deployed throughout large areas. In addition, in the mentioned areas, wireless communications can be difficult due to the presence of obstacles and metallic objects that block electromagnetic wave propagation totally or partially. This article details the development of a smart irrigation system able to cover large urban areas thanks to the use of Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) sensor nodes based on LoRa and LoRaWAN. IoT nodes collect soil temperature/moisture and air temperature data, and control water supply autonomously, either by making use of fog computing gateways or by relying on remote commands sent from a cloud. Since the selection of IoT node and gateway locations is essential to have good connectivity and to reduce energy consumption, this article uses an in-house 3D-ray launching radio-planning tool to determine the best locations in real scenarios. Specifically, this paper provides details on the modeling of a university campus, which includes elements like buildings, roads, green areas, or vehicles. In such a scenario, simulations and empirical measurements were performed for two different testbeds: a LoRaWAN testbed that operates at 868 MHz and a testbed based on LoRa with 433 MHz transceivers. All the measurements agree with the simulation results, showing the impact of shadowing effects and material features (e.g., permittivity, conductivity) in the electromagnetic propagation of near-ground and underground LoRaWAN communications. Higher RF power levels are observed for 433 MHz due to the higher transmitted power level and the lower radio propagation losses, and even in the worst gateway location, the received power level is higher than the sensitivity threshold (−148 dBm). Regarding water consumption, the provided estimations indicate that the proposed smart irrigation system is able to reduce roughly 23% of the amount of used water just by considering weather forecasts. The obtained results provide useful guidelines for future smart irrigation developers and show the radio planning tool accuracy, which allows for optimizing the sensor network topology and the overall performance of the network in terms of coverage, cost, and energy consumption.},
