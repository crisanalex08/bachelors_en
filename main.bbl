    Countries are working into making agriculture more sustainable by
  integrating different technologies to enhance its operation. Implementing
  improvements in irrigation systems is crucial for the water-use efficiency
  and works as a contributor to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the
  United Nations specifically Goal 6 and Target 6.4. This paper aims to
  highlight the contribution of SMART irrigation using Internet of Things (IoT)
  and sensory systems in relation to the SDGs. The study is based on a
  qualitative design along with focusing on secondary data collection method.
  Automated irrigation systems are essential for conservation of water, this
  improvement could have a vital role in minimizing water usage. Agriculture
  and farming techniques is also linked with IoT and automation, to make the
  whole processes much more effective and efficient. Sensory systems helped
  farmers better understand their crops and reduced the environmental impacts
  and conserve resources. Through these advanced systems effective soil and
  weather monitoring takes place along with efficient water management.
  Irrigation systems have been determined as positive contributor toward
  optimized irrigation systems that could enhance the use of continuous
  research and development which focus on enhancing the sustainable operations
  and cost reduction. Lastly, the challenges and benefits for the
  implementation of sensory based irrigation systems are discussed. This review
  will assist researchers and farmers to better understand irrigation
  techniques and provide an adequate approach would be sufficient to carry out
  irrigation related activities.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The recent intensification of agriculture, and the prospects of future
  intensification, will have major detrimental impacts on the nonagricultural
  terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of the world. The doubling of agricultural
  food production during the past 35 years was associated with a 6.87-fold
  increase in nitrogen fertilization, a 3.48-fold increase in phosphorus
  fertilization, a 1.68-fold increase in the amount of irrigated cropland, and
  a 1.1-fold increase in land in cultivation. Based on a simple linear
  extension of past trends, the anticipated next doubling of global food
  production would be associated with approximately 3-fold increases in
  nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization rates, a doubling of the irrigated land
  area, and an 18\% increase in cropland. These projected changes would have
  dramatic impacts on the diversity, composition, and functioning of the
  remaining natural ecosystems of the world, and on their ability to provide
  society with a variety of essential ecosystem services. The largest impacts
  would be on freshwater and marine ecosystems, which would be greatly
  eutrophied by high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus release from agricultural
  fields. Aquatic nutrient eutrophication can lead to loss of biodiversity,
  outbreaks of nuisance species, shifts in the structure of food chains, and
  impairment of fisheries. Because of aerial redistribution of various forms of
  nitrogen, agricultural intensification also would eutrophy many natural
  terrestrial ecosystems and contribute to atmospheric accumulation of
  greenhouse gases. These detrimental environmental impacts of agriculture can
  be minimized only if there is much more efficient use and recycling of
  nitrogen and phosphorus in agroecosystems.%

    Climate change is driving new solutions to manage water more efficiently.
  Such solutions involve the development of smart irrigation systems where
  Internet of Things (IoT) nodes are deployed throughout large areas. In
  addition, in the mentioned areas, wireless communications can be difficult
  due to the presence of obstacles and metallic objects that block
  electromagnetic wave propagation totally or partially. This article details
  the development of a smart irrigation system able to cover large urban areas
  thanks to the use of Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) sensor nodes based
  on LoRa and LoRaWAN. IoT nodes collect soil temperature/moisture and air
  temperature data, and control water supply autonomously, either by making use
  of fog computing gateways or by relying on remote commands sent from a cloud.
  Since the selection of IoT node and gateway locations is essential to have
  good connectivity and to reduce energy consumption, this article uses an
  in-house 3D-ray launching radio-planning tool to determine the best locations
  in real scenarios. Specifically, this paper provides details on the modeling
  of a university campus, which includes elements like buildings, roads, green
  areas, or vehicles. In such a scenario, simulations and empirical
  measurements were performed for two different testbeds: a LoRaWAN testbed
  that operates at 868 MHz and a testbed based on LoRa with 433 MHz
  transceivers. All the measurements agree with the simulation results, showing
  the impact of shadowing effects and material features (e.g., permittivity,
  conductivity) in the electromagnetic propagation of near-ground and
  underground LoRaWAN communications. Higher RF power levels are observed for
  433 MHz due to the higher transmitted power level and the lower radio
  propagation losses, and even in the worst gateway location, the received
  power level is higher than the sensitivity threshold (âˆ’148 dBm). Regarding
  water consumption, the provided estimations indicate that the proposed smart
  irrigation system is able to reduce roughly 23% of the amount of used water
  just by considering weather forecasts. The obtained results provide useful
  guidelines for future smart irrigation developers and show the radio planning
  tool accuracy, which allows for optimizing the sensor network topology and
  the overall performance of the network in terms of coverage, cost, and energy
  consumption.%

    Smart farming is a development that has emphasized information and

  network-based hi-tech farm supervision cycles. Innovative technologies, the
  Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing are anticipated to inspire

  Such ground-breaking deviations are unsettling current agriculture
  approaches, while also presenting a range of challenges. This paper
  investigates the tools and equipment used in applications of wireless sensors
  in IoT agriculture, and the anticipated challenges faced when merging
  technology with conventional farming activities. Furthermore, this technical

    The Internet of Things (IoT) has tremendous success in health care, smart

  fields which has broad application prospects of IoT. Protected agriculture is
  a mode of highly efficient development of modern agriculture that uses
  artificial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature, to
  create environmental conditions suitable for the growth of animals and
  plants. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of IoT
  applications in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure
  and key technologies. Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review
  of IoT research and deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10
  years and evaluated the contributions made by different academicians and
  organizations. Selected references were clustered into three application
  domains corresponding to plant management, animal farming and
  food/agricultural product supply traceability. Furthermore, we discussed the
  challenges along with future research prospects, to help new researchers of
  this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in protected
  agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Soil volumetric water content ( V W C ) is a vital parameter to understand
  several ecohydrological and environmental processes. Its cost-effective
  measurement can potentially drive various technological tools to promote
  data-driven sustainable agriculture through supplemental irrigation
  solutions, the lack of which has contributed to severe agricultural distress,
  particularly for smallholder farmers. The cost of commercially available V W
  C sensors varies over four orders of magnitude. A laboratory study
  characterizing and testing sensors from this wide range of cost categories,
  which is a prerequisite to explore their applicability for irrigation
  management, has not been conducted. Within this context, two low-cost
  capacitive sensorsâ€”SMEC300 and SM100â€”manufactured by Spectrum
  Technologies Inc. (Aurora, IL, USA), and two very low-cost resistive
  sensorsâ€”the Soil Hygrometer Detection Module Soil Moisture Sensor (YL100)
  by Electronicfans and the Generic Soil Moisture Sensor Module (YL69) by
  KitsGuruâ€”were tested for performance in laboratory conditions. Each sensor
  was calibrated in different repacked soils, and tested to evaluate accuracy,
  precision and sensitivity to variations in temperature and salinity. The
  capacitive sensors were additionally tested for their performance in liquids
  of known dielectric constants, and a comparative analysis of the calibration
  equations developed in-house and provided by the manufacturer was carried
  out. The value for money of the sensors is reflected in their precision
  performance, i.e., the precision performance largely follows sensor costs.
  The other aspects of sensor performance do not necessarily follow sensor
  costs. The low-cost capacitive sensors were more accurate than manufacturer
  specifications, and could match the performance of the secondary standard
  sensor, after soil specific calibration. SMEC300 is accurate ( M A E , R M S
  E , and R A E of 2.12%, 2.88% and 0.28 respectively), precise, and performed
  well considering its price as well as multi-purpose sensing capabilities. The
  less-expensive SM100 sensor had a better accuracy ( M A E , R M S E , and R A
  E of 1.67%, 2.36% and 0.21 respectively) but poorer precision than the
  SMEC300. However, it was established as a robust, field ready, low-cost
  sensor due to its more consistent performance in soils (particularly the
  field soil) and superior performance in fluids. Both the capacitive sensors
  responded reasonably to variations in temperature and salinity conditions.
  Though the resistive sensors were less accurate and precise compared to the
  capacitive sensors, they performed well considering their cost category. The
  YL100 was more accurate ( M A E , R M S E , and R A E of 3.51%, 5.21% and
  0.37 respectively) than YL69 ( M A E , R M S E , and R A E of 4.13%, 5.54%,
  and 0.41, respectively). However, YL69 outperformed YL100 in terms of
  precision, and response to temperature and salinity variations, to emerge as
  a more robust resistive sensor. These very low-cost sensors may be used in
  combination with more accurate sensors to better characterize the
  spatiotemporal variability of field scale soil moisture. The laboratory
  characterization conducted in this study is a prerequisite to estimate the
  effect of low- and very low-cost sensor measurements on the efficiency of
  soil moisture based irrigation scheduling systems.%
